In statistics, this error is typically considered to have random characteristics and it is part of evaluating statistical models (often denoted $ \\varepsilon$).\n",

    "So we always expect our *true* value to be muddled up with some measurement error. In the previous chapter, we could see how the *standard error of the mean* decreased with increasing sample sizes. For small samples our estimate of the true population mean is not very accurate. The larger the sample size, the closer we get to the true population mean - but for most practical purposes it is okay not to be extremely precise. Especially if larger sample sizes are connected to high costs in resources (which they typically are). \n",
    "\n",
    "In engineering, the precision of a measure is expressed as a certain *tolerance* (e.g. $\\pm 0.02$) that indicates the size of the error or how much the value is allowed to vary (without affecting the functionality). The smaller the range of tolerance, the more precise the measurement will be."

    "We cannot be sure about the exactness of the true value, but we can calculate confidence intervals around it. The confidence interval gives a range within which we, with some confidence, would expect the true value to end up. The width of this interval is dependent on the variation in the population (which we estimate from the sample standard deviation); the size of the sample size (as mentioned above); and the level of confidence.\n",

    "A *95% confidence interval* tells us that if we were to draw samples of this population 100 times, we would expect that **in 95 of these 100 samples, the true population mean would fall within the range given by the confidence interval.** \n",

    "\n",
    "We cannot control the variability in the population we sample from, so if we need to keep the confidence level fixed, the only thing left to affect the width of the confidence interval is the size of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of data (continous, discrete, distribution, etc.) there are different ways to calculate the confidence intervals. For continuous data we can relate back to the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation for the distribution of sample means. Since this is normally distributed, we know that 95% of values lie within  $\\pm 1.96 \\sigma_{\\bar{x}}$  on each side. So a rough estimate of the 95% confidence interval is four times the standard error around the sample mean."

T-distribution is symmetric and bellshaped, but its shape is slightly different for small sample sizes.

    "### 2.1  Reliability\n",
    "We can test, and retest, a technical system to see that the same input consistently gives the same output - that it is reliable. \n",
    "But how can we assess reliability when collecting data from human participants? Also here, we can estimate the consistency by *measuring and re-measuring*. For instance, by asking a participants to rate the same stimulus several times to check test-retest reliability. Either on different test occasions or by repeating the same task on the same test occasion (Preferably mixed with other stimuli so that the repetition is not too obvious). You can also look for inter-rater reliability by comparing ratings from several people. If the ratings are the same, or very similar, you have a reliable measure (similar to the points gathered close together in the target images)."

    "### 2.2  Internal and External Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have highly reliable but invalid results if we, for example, recruit participants that are systematically different from the intended population. This would yield a problem with *external validity*, as the results do not generalize to the larger population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Badly planned experiments can also have problem with *internal validity*. One example of this would be if there are unintended systematic differences between experimental and control groups (other than by our manipulation). For instance, data would likely be invalid if we recruit participants to the control group from passers-by in the street, but the experimental group consists of our friends and colleagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we check for validity? In the case of finding out if someone has musical skill, we can compare their self-report of musical skill with the judgments of experts. For instance, by letting several music teachers independently assess the participant's skill. If their assessments agree with the self-report, there is good support for the validity of our measurement instrument. "

    "An example of a Likert scale is [The System Usability Scale (SUS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_usability_scale), which consists of 10 items with statements that are rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). All items are targeting the experienced usability (and learnability) of the system and contribute toward a combined score. Note that the scale is *balanced* in that there are both positively and negatively formulated statements. When scoring, the ratings of negative items needs to be \"inverted\" or \"flipped\".\n",
